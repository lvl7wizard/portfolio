        About
      </h2>
      <p>
        My journey into coding began as a hobby in 2020, driven by passion for
        creation, problem-solving, and continuous learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        In October 2023, I took the plunge to take my skills to the next level
        by enrolling in an intensive three-month full-time Software Engineering
        bootcamp with an esteemed organisation called Northcoders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through completing this course, I solidified a robust foundation in both
        frontend and backend web development, gaining hands-on experience with
        the latest industry practices and technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now equipped with a comprehensive skill set and a desire for growth, I
        am excited to embark on the next chapter of my journey through
        professional roles, freelance work, or collaborative projects.
