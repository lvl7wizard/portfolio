        About
      </h2>
      <p>
        ðŸš€ My journey into coding began as a hobby in 2020, driven by a passion for
        creation, problem-solving, and continuous learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        ðŸŽ“ In March 2024, I graduated from a 13-week full-time Software Engineering
        bootcamp at Northcoders where I solidified my understanding of front-end and back-end web technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        ðŸŒ± I'm now excited to utilise and continue to develop my skills as I begin my career as a Junior Developer.
